\chapter{Requirements for this approach}
  \label{chap:requr}

%   To summarize, an interactive visualization technique for web-based accessibility maps should adhere to the following requirements and challenges: it should support a web-based, hardware-accelerated implementation using WebGL~\cite{Parisi2012}~(R1); a standardized and compact data representation that allows for decoupling network geometry from temporal data to reduce data transmission and updates~(R2); as well as enable interactive client-side filtering, mapping, and rendering for visual feedback~(R3).

  % one way of communicating mobility information such as travel times are two dimensional maps
  % accessibility and mobility becomes a central topic in a growing number of fields
  % there are strong demands for corresponding web mapping components
  % based on massive geodata sets, such as osm

    This project focuses on the JavaScript webmapping framework \textit{Leaflet-JS} [??]. Better alternatives with a more advanced WebGL-integration are available (e.g. \textit{OpenLayers 3}) but a high compatibility with the existing \textit{Route360-JS} API developed by Motion Intelligence GmbH [??] is a requirement for this project. Therefore, Leaflet will be used.\par
    There is no native support for WebGL in Leaflet, yet\footnote{While writing this paper, a spanish software engineer, Iván Sánchez Ortega, started working on a Leaflet.GL plugin architecture [??] which was not taken into consideration as it is still experimental and was not available when this project implementation was started.}. Along with this implementation, a handful of Leaflet plugins will be developed which support a future WebGL integration [??][??] (see section {sec:tile}).\par
