    This project focuses on the JavaScript webmapping framework \textit{Leaflet-JS} [15]. Better alternatives with a more advanced WebGL-integration are available (e.g. \textit{OpenLayers 3}) but a high compatibility with the existing \textit{Route360-JS} API developed by Motion Intelligence GmbH [24] is a requirement for this project. Therefore, Leaflet will be used.\par
    There is no native support for WebGL in Leaflet, yet\footnote{While writing this paper, a spanish software engineer, Iván Sánchez Ortega, started working on a Leaflet.GL plugin architecture [17] which was not taken into consideration as it is still experimental and was not available when this project implementation was started.}. Along with this implementation, a handful of Leaflet plugins will be developed which support a future WebGL integration [19][18] (see section \ref{sec:tile}).\par
