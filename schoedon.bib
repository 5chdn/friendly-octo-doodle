  title = { Interactive Web-based Visualization for Accessibility Mapping of Transportation Networks },
  year = { 2016 },
  month = { 6 },
  abstract = { Accessibility is a fundamental aspect in transportation, routing, and spare-time activity planning concerning traveling in modern cities. In this context, interactive web-based accessibility-map visualization techniques and systems are important tools for provisioning, exploration, analysis, and assessment of multi-modal and location-based travel time data and routing information. To enable their effective application, such interactive visualization techniques demands for flexible mappings with respect to user-adjustable parameters such as maximum travel times, the types of transportation used, or used color schemes. However, traditional approaches for web-based visualization of accessibility-maps do not allow this degree of parametrization without significant latencies introduced by required data processing and transmission between the routing server and the visualization client. This paper presents a novel web-based visualization technique that allows for efficient client-side mapping and rendering of accessibility data onto transportation networks using WebGL and the OpenGL transmission format. A performance evaluation and comparison shows the superior performance of the approach over alternative implementations. },

  },
  booktitle = { Proceedings of CyberWorlds 2014 },
  year = { 2014 },
  pages = { 172-181 },
  publisher = { IEEE Computer Society },
  abstract = { With increasing numbers of flights world-wide and a continuing rise
  in airport traffic, air-traffic management is faced with a number
  of challenges. These include monitoring, reporting, planning, and
  problem analysis of past and current air traffic, e.g., to identify
  hotspots, minimize delays, or to optimize sector assignments to air-traffic
  controllers. Interactive and dynamic 3D visualization and visual
  analysis of massive aircraft trajectories, i.e., analytical reasoning
  enabled by interactive cyber worlds, can be used to approach these
  challenges. To facilitate this kind of analysis, especially in the
  context of real-time data, interactive tools for filtering, mapping,
  and rendering are required. In particular, the mapping process should
  be configurable at run-time and support both static mappings and
  animations to allow users to effectively explore and realize movement
  dynamics. However, with growing data size and complexity, these stages
  of the visualization pipeline require computational efficient implementations
  to be capable of processing within real-time constraints. This paper
  presents an approach for real-time animated visualization of massive
  air-traffic data, that implements all stages of the visualization
  pipeline based on GPU techniques for efficient processing. It enables
  (1) interactive spatio-temporal filtering, (2) generic mapping of
  trajectory attributes to geometric representations and appearances,
  as well as (3) real-time rendering within 3D virtual environments,
  such as virtual 3D airport and city models. Based on this pipeline,
  different visualization metaphors (e.g., temporal focus+context,
  density maps, and overview+detail visualization) are implemented
  and discussed. The presented concepts and implementation can be generally
  used as visual analytics and data mining techniques in cyber worlds,
  e.g., to visualize movement data, geo-referenced networks, or other
  spatio-temporal data. },
