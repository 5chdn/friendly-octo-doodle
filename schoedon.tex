\addchap{Abstract}
Accessibility is a fundamental aspect in transportation, routing, and spare-time
activity planning concerning traveling in modern cities. In this context,
interactive web-based accessibility-map visualization techniques and systems
are important tools for provisioning, exploration, analysis, and assessment of
multi-modal and location-based travel time data and routing information. To
enable their effective application, such interactive visualization techniques
demands for flexible mappings with respect to user-adjustable parameters such
as maximum travel times, the types of transportation used, or displayed color
schemes. However, traditional approaches for web-based visualization of
transportation networks do not allow this degree of parametrization without
significant latencies introduced by required data processing and transmission
between the routing server and the visualization client. This thesis presents
a novel web-based visualization technique that allows for efficient client-side
mapping and rendering of accessibility data onto complex transportation
networks using WebGL and glTF. A performance evaluation and comparison shows
the superior performance of the approach over alternative implementations.
